# 6.826 POCS Labs

## Lab 1: StatDB

In this lab, you will implement a database that supports adding numbers and
getting the mean of the numbers added so far. Your proof will connect the
implementation (which only tracks the count and the sum) to a specification that
tracks all the input numbers.

To run your code, compile with `make` and then run `./bin/statdb-cli`. Exit by
pressing `Ctrl-c`.

## Notes

Please do not post your solutions publicly. We plan to use this material for
future editions of 6.826.
