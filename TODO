Things to clean up:

- RemappedDisk: make sure that we can replace the abstraction relation with an abstraction function
  as defined in the [init] part of the proof at the bottom of RemappedDiskImpl.v.

- students need to install haskell-stack

- Why [prog_spec] is useful: avoid having to reason about execution of functions twice
  (once for normal execution -- postcondition, and once for crashes -- recovery condition).
  That ends up with a quadratic number of subgoals.

- lab for POCS: 1 disk, but update two sectors atomically

- minimal NBD client that reads/writes sectors, to test/demo remap-nbd with broken write
