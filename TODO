Things to clean up:

- Tej's issues with bad sector remapping:

  * It took a while to understand the connection between the goals and
    my implementation.
  * Small changes to the abstraction and implementation required
    mechanical changes to the proof.
  * Simplifying and manipulating the goals was incredibly painful;
    I avoided any automation or lemmas, but still used the fancy tricks
    I know or had implemented (there are plenty of comments to see what
    I did - I left all of the searches I did in).

- RemappedDisk: make sure that we can replace the abstraction relation with an abstraction function
  as defined in the [init] part of the proof at the bottom of RemappedDiskImpl.v.

- students need to install haskell-stack

- Why [prog_spec] is useful: avoid having to reason about execution of functions twice
  (once for normal execution -- postcondition, and once for crashes -- recovery condition).
  That ends up with a quadratic number of subgoals.

- lab for POCS: 1 disk, but update two sectors atomically

- minimal NBD client that reads/writes sectors, to test/demo remap-nbd with broken write
