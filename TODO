Things to clean up:

- move Hoare specs of an API (such as src/TwoDisk/TwoDiskTheorems.v) into the next level up,
  because they are simply helpers for the next layer.

- have a single Require Import statement that brings in all the useful things, including
  EquivDec and Omega.

- mechanically check assumed facts to make sure students didn't state some axiom (e.g., Axiom False)
  or import NoCrashes when we wanted them to prove crashes.  (use Print Assumptions ...)
