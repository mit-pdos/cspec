Things to clean up:

- it would be nice if [prog_spec_symbolic_execute] labeled the subgoals it
  created based on the if statements that led to it.  an easy way to do this
  would be to introduce a "Label" opcode to the language.

- RemappedDisk: make sure that we can replace the abstraction relation with an abstraction function
  as defined in the [init] part of the proof at the bottom of RemappedDiskImpl.v.

- students need to install haskell-stack

- Why [prog_spec] is useful: avoid having to reason about execution of functions twice
  (once for normal execution -- postcondition, and once for crashes -- recovery condition).
  That ends up with a quadratic number of subgoals.

  Also [prog_spec] helps avoid the many cases generated by [prog_spec_symbolic_execute]
  in RemappedDiskImpl.v, as an example.

- lab for POCS: 1 disk, but update two sectors atomically

- minimal NBD client that reads/writes sectors, to test/demo remap-nbd with broken write
