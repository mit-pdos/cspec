Things to clean up:

- move Hoare specs of an API (such as src/TwoDisk/TwoDiskTheorems.v) into the next level up,
  because they are simply helpers for the next layer.

- have a single Require Import statement that brings in all the useful things, including
  EquivDec and Omega.

- where do we specify that the initial state after StatDB's init
  completes, corresponds to an empty history?  probably should
  add a [init : State -> Prop] field to [InterfaceAPI] in
  src/Refinement/Interface.v
