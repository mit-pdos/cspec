=== Logging

How to use a disk where a write may fail?
  Consider a single disk
  Consider banking application

Example: transfer (a, b, 10)
  requires updating two blocks

Naive plan
  write block a
  write block b
  what if we crash in the middle?
  can we undo?
  can we complete?

Better plan
  no updates in place

=== Relaxing assumptions

Atomic sector write

Sector corruption

Asynchronous disks
