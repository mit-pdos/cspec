L0: Intro reasoning about crashes and failures

* Goal: verify systems that have persistent state but may fail
  Examples:
    file systems, databases,
    internal software on storage controlers (e.g., SSD)
  Two kinds of failures:
    crashes (e.g., power failures)
    devices stops working (e.g., dead disk, dead sector)
  Assumption: fail-stop
    after failure, computer systems stops immediately
    on crash, computer reboots and one can run repair

* Motivation: dealing with failures is difficult
  Persistent state becomes inconsistent
    E.g., failure during a two-step operation (e.g., updating free list and file)
    -> Block is marked allocated, but isn't in use
    -> Block is part of a file, but not marked allocated
  Storage runs concurrent with program
    While operation is in progress storage fails
    E.g., update one disk, but fail to update second disk
  Storage devices are slower than main memory
    Many complex optimizations to avoid disks writes
    Complexity leads to more opportunities for problems

* Examples:
  Linux file system study [http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ll/papers/fsstudy.pdf]
    FSCQ slides [https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/fscq:sosp15-slides.pdf]
  SSD study [https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/fast13/fast13-final80.pdf]
  Promising area for verification
    Bugs can have bad consequences
    Complex systems, easy to have bugs

* Active area of research
  Many bug-finding tools
  Model checking
  Some verification
    This and next 3 lectures explore verification approach
    
* 2 labs to illustrate issues
  verified remapping disk
    deals with one bad sector
  verified replicated disks
    deals with device failures
    
* demo of replicated disk
    pull out a disk

* Verification approach: state machine and simulation
  standard 2-layer diagram
    See chapter 6 and 8 of [http://bwlampson.site/48-POCScourse/48-POCS2006.pdf]
    modules as state machines
    state machine: state + transitions
    two state machines:
      spec state machine (the spec)
      code state machine (the implementation)
    abstraction function
    initial state
    proofs: back-ward simulation

* Example: StatDB (chapter 8)
  StatDB
  spec state machine:
    state:
      db: multiset of all values (ints) written to data db
    transistions:
      add: adds value
      size: size of set
      mean: add all value and divide by size
  code state machine:
    state:
     sum: sum of values added so far
     count: number of values
    transitions: add, size, and mean
  proof: backward simulation
    from implementation to spec:
      initial states line up
      for each transition of implementation, there exists a corresponding spec transition

* StatDB in Coq
  Refinement
  Exec
  Variables

* Implement and proof [add]

* Exercise: implement and proof [mean]
  Install stack & build
  Implement mean and run
  Prove mean

* Homework: remapping disk
  Disks instead of Variables
  Your goal: abstraction function and proof ...
  Do demo of not working
