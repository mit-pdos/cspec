Possible projects

- Support spawn
  need to reproof all core lemmas
  modify mail server to spwan pop and smtp threads

- Code gen
  generate Go code for unfolded mailserver program
  compare to our hand-written Go implementation (gomail)
  Go instead of C, so we don't have to deal with low-level memory management

- Less clunky horizontal composition
  Maybe use objects + separation logic
  Use it to have several locks

- Crashes and concurrency
  Modify exec to support crashes
  Do layered recovery a la POCS
  Have top-level crash-safety theorem for mail server

- Lock-free data structures with TSO
  look-free cache

- Concurrent POSIX spec
  Model open() isn't atomic
  Slide fd layer under current bottom layer
  Proof atomicity of pathname lookups in context of mail server
  
  Maybe a good base for scalable commutativity
    proof implementation scales
    Need memory model
 
- Adopt for distributed systems
  Maybe can generalize horizon composition

- Mail server security
  Use sfscq infrastructure for mail server
