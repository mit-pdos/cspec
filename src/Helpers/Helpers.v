(** * Decidable equality.

    [EqualDec] defines a notion of decidable equality for things
    of type [A].  This means that there is a function, called
    [equal_dec], which, given two things of type [A], will return
    whether they are equal or not.
  *)

Class EqualDec A :=
  equal_dec : forall x y : A, { x = y } + { x <> y }.

(**
    We define the notation [x == y] to mean our decidable equality
    between [x] and [y].
  *)

Notation " x == y " := (equal_dec (x :>) (y :>)) (no associativity, at level 70).

(**
    Here, we define some types for which we know how to compute
    decidable equality (namely, equality for [nat]s, and equality
    for [bool]s).
  *)

Instance nat_equal_dec : EqualDec nat := eq_nat_dec.
Instance bool_equal_dec : EqualDec bool := bool_dec.

Instance string_equal_dec : EqualDec string := string_dec.
Instance list_equal_dec A `{dec:EqualDec A} : EqualDec (list A) := list_eq_dec dec.

Instance pair_equal_dec A B `{ea:EqualDec A} `{eb:EqualDec B} : EqualDec (A*B).

(** * [maybe_holds] predicate.

    One pattern that shows up in our lab assignments is that we
    want to say something about an optional value.  That is, we
    have something of type [option T], which is either [Some x]
    where [x] is of type [T], or is [None].  We want to make
    staements of the form ``if it's [Some x], then something is
    true about [x]''.  This shows up when we talk about a disk
    that might or might not have failed, or when we talk about
    the contents of a disk block that might or might not be there
    (e.g., because it's out of bounds).

    We define [maybe_holds] to formalize this notion.  [maybe_holds]
    takes a predicate, [T -> Prop], and an [option T].
  *)

Definition maybe_holds T (p:T -> Prop) : option T -> Prop :=
  fun mt => match mt with
         | Some t => p t
         | None => True
         end.

Theorem holds_in_none_eq : forall T (p:T -> Prop) mt,
    mt = None ->
    maybe_holds p mt.

    mt = Some v ->

Theorem pred_weaken : forall T (p p': T -> Prop) mt,
    maybe_holds p mt ->
    (forall t, p t -> p' t) ->
    maybe_holds p' mt.
Proof.
  unfold maybe_holds; destruct mt; eauto.
Qed.

(** To reflect the expected usage of this primitive, we define
    two notations:

    - [mv ?|= p] states that [p] holds on [mv], if [mv] is present.
      This notation simply translates to [maybe_holds p mv].

    - To state that an optional value is definitely missing,
      we provide a predicate [missing], so that [mv ?|= missing]
      implies that [mv] is [None].  The [missing] predicate is simply
      [False], which allows us to conclude by contradiction that
      there's no way the optional value could be [Some x].
  *)

Notation "m ?|= F" := (maybe_holds F m) (at level 20, F at level 50).

Definition missing {T} : T -> Prop := fun _ => False.

Theorem pred_missing : forall T (p: T -> Prop) mt,
    mt ?|= missing ->
    mt ?|= p.
Proof.
  unfold missing; intros.
  eapply pred_weaken; eauto.
  contradiction.
Qed.


(** * Proof automation.

    To help prove various theorems, we provide some basic automation.
    This automation takes the form of Ltac scripts that are designed
    to solve certain types of goals, or simplify the goal in some way.
    We also use hints (using various [Hint] statements), which is a
    way to tell Coq which theorems should be used by tactics like
    [auto], [eauto], [autorewrite], and so on.
  *)
